## Description

-   **Airbnb** is an opportunity for me to enhance my programming skills and experiment with some new technologies that I've learnt recently (e.g. RESTful API, TailwindCss, Ant Design and ReduxToolkit) as well. The project implements some pages of the original [Aribnb](https://www.airbnb.com.vn/)

## Features
